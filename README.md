# OpenAI-DiscordChat

A Discord chatbot that uses OpenAI for its responses.

## Project Setup
After cloning this repository, this project won't immediately be able to run.
Here are the steps needed to get it up and running!

1. Install all required packages from `requirements.txt`
2. Create `keys.py` in the `src` module. Here's how that should look!
    ```python
    OpenAI: str = ""  # Your OpenAI key goes in the quotation marks
    ```
3. (Optional) Create `prompt.txt` in the src module. When making calls to OpenAI, 
this prompt is included in the API call which gives GPT-3 context for how it 
responds to you! If you don't create this file, no extra context will be provided.

## hi
### hi
